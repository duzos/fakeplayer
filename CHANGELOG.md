# v3.0.0

## NEW

- added Quartermaster and Runner jobs. mark storage with the Pool marker, and Runners collect and deliver requested items.
- request items from the Quartermaster's Browse menu: click for a stack, sneak-click for one, ctrl-click for all. you can track and cancel orders there too.
- added modded fishing rod support. thanks to RageQKM for the Aquaculture report and suggestion.
- added Aquaculture tackle, bait, hook textures and dyed lines on Forge/NeoForge. lava fishing also works with its lava fishing addon and a suitable hook.
- addons can register jobs and manage item requests through the API.
## CHANGED

- jobs now use namespaced IDs. existing jobs carry over; missing addon jobs keep their settings until you reinstall the addon or change the job.
- Runners show deliveries in their hand and return to their Quartermaster when idle. requests use the nearest Quartermaster with stock.
- requests wait if they can't be filled, with one message per problem. messages sent while you're offline arrive when you log back in.
- request range now defaults to 256 blocks. custom settings are kept.
- fishermen use vanilla fishing loot, including mod additions. custom tackle bonuses currently only work with Aquaculture; Fishing Real catches stay as items.
- fishermen keep their equipped rod, deposit spares and take a replacement from storage when needed. offhand rods work too.
- the addon request API now takes namespaced job IDs.
## FIXED

- fixed the Fabric startup crash from the fishing rod cast model. thanks to user_ibivn35hvseplw7798233 for reporting it on 1.21.4.
- fishermen now aim for open water so they can catch treasure.
- fishermen request a missing rod and resume when it arrives.
- working fakes no longer follow a held redstone torch.
## REMOVED

- none.
